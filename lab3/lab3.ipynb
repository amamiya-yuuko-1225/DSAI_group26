    "# Problem 1: Spam & Ham\n",
    "\n",
    "## A. Data exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "By the judgment as a human being, these following features makes me able to tell spam apart from ham:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Topic and related key words: Spam emails mostly focus on commodity promotion, dating/porn website promotion, and pure scam. For commodity promotion emails, there are key words related to prices, such as \"$\", \"cash\", and \"cheap\"; for dating/porn website promotion, there are key words concerning sexual features, such as \"amateur\", \"wives\", and \"girls\"; for scam emails, mostly, might focus on topics like unexpected fortune or job opportunities. By contrast, ham emails have various topics, including work-related content, personal communication, and legitimate newsletters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Structure of the `HTML` content: Spam emails are usually generated from a fixed template, thus most of them have complex and fancy `HTML` structures. These can include various fonts, colors, and embedded media. On the other hand, ham emails are simple and neat in most cases, which focuses on direct communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Spam markers: Spam emails tend to be marked as AD by mail server admins and users, while ham emails do not. Moreover, spam emails sometimes explicitly assert \"This is NOT spam!\" or something similar, which is a very poor lie that reveals the truth. On the other hand, ham emails lack such markers and are usually consistent in terms of content and senders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the reasons that make hard ham emails different from easy ham emails but similar to spam emails are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Similar content to spams: Hard ham emails also focus on promotion of commodities, companies, etc. This makes hard ham emails look like spams, especially in their subject and promotion words.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Created from templates: Hard ham emails are also created from templates and sent to a large amount of people, which resembles spams in terms of `HTML` structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though hard ham emails are hard to distinguish from spams, there is a key feature that differentiates those two: Most hard ham emails have \"unsubcribe\" key word, meaning that the receivers can reject further emailing. However, spam emails rarely provide such function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## B. Data splitting\n",
    "\n",
    "We perform the train-test set split with a ratio of 3:1 by invoking `train_test_split()` function in `sklean.model_selection` package."

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "# Problem 2: Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "We read email files from specified categories (`easy_ham`, `hard_ham`, and `spam`) and stores their content in a DataFrame for further analysis.\n",
    "In the `read_email_file`, we try to read the content of an email file using different encodings (ascii, iso-8859-1, and utf-8) to handle potential encoding issues. If one encoding fails, the function attempts the next one, ensuring that most email files can be read without errors.\n",
    "For each email file, the content is read using `read_email_file` and a dictionary containing the content (`BOW`) and its category (`Category`) is created."
